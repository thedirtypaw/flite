          column1Text="This isn't just another protein powder - it's the magic of our triple-processing method. Germination awakens dormant peas, increasing bioavailability and creating natural enzymes. Hydrolysis breaks proteins into easily digestible peptides your body absorbs instantly. Fermentation adds beneficial probiotics while creating bioactive compounds that support gut health and immune function. The result is a protein powder that nourishes your entire system with the concentrated power of what peas were always meant to become."

The dual-processing method transforms natural pea fiber components through germination, which activates and modifies the fiber structure, followed by fermentation that further develops the material. This creates a fiber ingredient with enhanced functional properties compared to conventional pea fiber, offering improved performance characteristics while maintaining the natural benefits of plant-based fiber."

          column1Text="The food system is broken and needs fundamental change. Industrial agriculture drives 25% of global emissions while destroying biodiversity, with animal husbandry alone accounting for 15% of global emissions. Meanwhile, consumers are demanding better â€“ they want sustainable, nutrient-dense food with short ingredient lists, clear labeling, and a genuine connection to where their food comes from. Conventional protein isolates, whether plant-based or animal, fall short with poor bioavailability, digestibility issues, and often contain allergens, trace chemicals, and synthetic additives that consumers increasingly reject."
          column2Text="The current system locks incumbents into centralized production and fragile supply chains while making it difficult for farmers to transition to biodiversity-positive farming. Farmers want technical and financial support to shift to profitable regenerative practices, but EU policy ambitions for sustainable agriculture are slow to implement, and market mechanisms like biodiversity credits remain in their infancy. Our approach bridges this gap by creating a direct pathway for farmers to participate in food innovation while producing ingredients that meet the growing demand for traceable, local, and truly sustainable nutrition."
